# Analysis and Prediction of Factors Influencing Success in Crowdfunding Projects: A Case Study of Kickstarter 🚀

## Project Description
In this project, a comprehensive study conducted to identify the key factors that influence the success of crowdfunding projects on the Kickstarter platform. We utilized a dataset obtained from Maven Analytics' Data playground, which comprised 374,853 observations and 11 attributes. The primary focus was on project category, the number of pledges, and project goals. 📊💡

## Project Highlights
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performed EDA to gain valuable insights into the dataset and visualized attribute distributions. 📈🔍
- **Data Pre-processing:** Data pre-processing involved correcting errors, handling missing values, eliminating redundant attributes, and addressing outliers. 🧹🛠️
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Employed three machine learning algorithms for training and testing the dataset: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbor. 🤖📚
- **Performance Evaluation:** Evaluated the performance of these machine learning models using specific metrics designed for prediction tasks. 📊📈
